                    We first collected all the materials needed for the project. Wood, nails, screws, and bolts were picked up 
                    from Home Depot, while a used couch was found on the side of the street. Additional tools were borrowed 
                    from the garage, and the wheels for the cart were ordered online from Amazon.

                <p>
                    The frame of the cart was constructed by carefully cutting the wood to the right sizes. The pieces
                    were nailed together to form a sturdy base, and the four non-motorized wheels were attached to the 
                    corners, allowing the frame to move freely in any direction.

                <p>
                    The wheels with built-in motors were wired by soldering connections to ensure proper power flow. Attention 
                    was paid to make sure the wiring was secure and well-insulated to avoid any short circuits during operation.

                <p>
                    Finally, all components were assembled together. The couch was mounted on the wooden frame, wheels and motor 
                    wiring were double-checked, and the cart was tested to confirm that everything functioned smoothly as a complete unit.
